## Why JAX?

JAX (Just-in-time compilation for NumPy programs): The core for building and training models. Teach it as a high-performance numerical computing library. Its key advantage is compiling Python/NumPy code directly to optimized machine code for CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs using XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra).


### JAX Core Concepts 
- Pure Functions 
- jax.jit (Just-in-time compilation)
- jax.grad (Gradient)
- jax.vmap (Vectorization)
