In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2. Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19]. End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence- aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [28].

Innovation in attention mechanisms enabled the transformer architecture that yielded the modern large language models (LLMs) that power popular applications like ChatGPT. [...] For an autoregressive, self-attention-based LLM to be capable of translating text, all of the words the model encounters in training—across every language—are learned as part of one large multilingual token vocabulary. The model simply realizes that when a sequence contains instructions like “translate [words in Language 1] into Language 2,” the next words in the sequence should be tokens from Language 2. [...] In self-attention, queries, keys and values are all drawn from the same source. Whereas both Bahdanau and Luong’s attention mechanisms were explicitly designed for machine translation, Cheng at al proposed self-attention—which they called “intra-attention”—as a method to improve machine reading in general.
