    "summary": "The adoption of Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) enables automation and\nreliable model deployments across industries. However, differing MLOps\nlifecycle frameworks and maturity models proposed by industry, academia, and\norganizations have led to confusion regarding standard adoption practices. This\npaper introduces a unified MLOps lifecycle framework, further incorporating\nLarge Language Model Operations (LLMOps), to address this gap. Additionally, we\noutlines key roles, tools, and costs associated with MLOps adoption at various\nmaturity levels. By providing a standardized framework, we aim to help\norganizations clearly define and allocate the resources needed to implement\nMLOps effectively.",

    "summary": "Context. Despite the increasing adoption of Machine Learning Operations\n(MLOps), teams still encounter challenges in effectively applying this paradigm\nto their specific projects. While there is a large variety of available tools\nusable for MLOps, there is simultaneously a lack of consolidated architecture\nknowledge that can inform the architecture design. Objective. Our primary\nobjective is to provide a comprehensive overview of (i) how MLOps architectures\nare defined across the literature and (ii) which tools are mentioned to support\nthe implementation of each architecture component. Method. We apply the\nSystematic Mapping Study method and select 43 primary studies via automatic,\nmanual, and snowballing-based search and selection procedures. Subsequently, we\nuse card sorting to synthesize the results. Results. We contribute (i) a\ncategorization of 35 MLOps architecture components, (ii) a description of\nseveral MLOps architecture variants, and (iii) a systematic map between the\nidentified components and the existing MLOps tools. Conclusion. This study\nprovides an overview of the state of the art in MLOps from an architectural\nperspective. Researchers and practitioners can use our findings to inform the\narchitecture design of their MLOps systems.",

    "summary": "MLOps has emerged as a key solution to address many socio-technical\nchallenges of bringing ML models to production, such as integrating ML models\nwith non-ML software, continuous monitoring, maintenance, and retraining of\ndeployed models. Despite the utility of MLOps, an integrated body of knowledge\nregarding MLOps remains elusive because of its extensive scope due to the\ndiversity of ML productionalization challenges it addresses. Whilst the\nexisting literature reviews provide valuable snapshots of specific practices,\ntools, and research prototypes related to MLOps at various times, they focus on\nparticular facets of MLOps, thus fail to offer a comprehensive and invariant\nframework that can weave these perspectives into a unified understanding of\nMLOps. This paper presents a Multivocal Literature Review that systematically\nanalyzes a corpus of 150 peer-reviewed and 48 grey literature to synthesize a\nunified conceptualization of MLOps and develop a snapshot of its best\npractices, adoption challenges, and solutions.",
