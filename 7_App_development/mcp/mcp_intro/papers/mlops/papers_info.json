    "summary": "The adoption of Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) enables automation and\nreliable model deployments across industries. However, differing MLOps\nlifecycle frameworks and maturity models proposed by industry, academia, and\norganizations have led to confusion regarding standard adoption practices. This\npaper introduces a unified MLOps lifecycle framework, further incorporating\nLarge Language Model Operations (LLMOps), to address this gap. Additionally, we\noutlines key roles, tools, and costs associated with MLOps adoption at various\nmaturity levels. By providing a standardized framework, we aim to help\norganizations clearly define and allocate the resources needed to implement\nMLOps effectively.",

    "summary": "Context. Despite the increasing adoption of Machine Learning Operations\n(MLOps), teams still encounter challenges in effectively applying this paradigm\nto their specific projects. While there is a large variety of available tools\nusable for MLOps, there is simultaneously a lack of consolidated architecture\nknowledge that can inform the architecture design. Objective. Our primary\nobjective is to provide a comprehensive overview of (i) how MLOps architectures\nare defined across the literature and (ii) which tools are mentioned to support\nthe implementation of each architecture component. Method. We apply the\nSystematic Mapping Study method and select 43 primary studies via automatic,\nmanual, and snowballing-based search and selection procedures. Subsequently, we\nuse card sorting to synthesize the results. Results. We contribute (i) a\ncategorization of 35 MLOps architecture components, (ii) a description of\nseveral MLOps architecture variants, and (iii) a systematic map between the\nidentified components and the existing MLOps tools. Conclusion. This study\nprovides an overview of the state of the art in MLOps from an architectural\nperspective. Researchers and practitioners can use our findings to inform the\narchitecture design of their MLOps systems.",

    "summary": "MLOps has emerged as a key solution to address many socio-technical\nchallenges of bringing ML models to production, such as integrating ML models\nwith non-ML software, continuous monitoring, maintenance, and retraining of\ndeployed models. Despite the utility of MLOps, an integrated body of knowledge\nregarding MLOps remains elusive because of its extensive scope due to the\ndiversity of ML productionalization challenges it addresses. Whilst the\nexisting literature reviews provide valuable snapshots of specific practices,\ntools, and research prototypes related to MLOps at various times, they focus on\nparticular facets of MLOps, thus fail to offer a comprehensive and invariant\nframework that can weave these perspectives into a unified understanding of\nMLOps. This paper presents a Multivocal Literature Review that systematically\nanalyzes a corpus of 150 peer-reviewed and 48 grey literature to synthesize a\nunified conceptualization of MLOps and develop a snapshot of its best\npractices, adoption challenges, and solutions.",

Different MLOps tools have been presented on the market,\nhowever, such a number of tools often create confusion on the most appropriate\ntool to be used in each DevOps phase. To overcome this issue, we conducted a\nmultivocal literature review mapping 84 MLOps tools identified from 254 Primary\nStudies, on the DevOps phases, highlighting their purpose, and possible\nincompatibilities. The result of this work will be helpful to both\npractitioners and researchers, as a starting point for future investigations on\nMLOps tools, pipelines, and processes.",

    "summary": "This article presents an experiment focused on optimizing the MLOps (Machine\nLearning Operations) process, a crucial aspect of efficiently implementing\nmachine learning projects. The objective is to identify patterns and insights\nto enhance the MLOps workflow, considering its iterative and interdependent\nnature in real-world model development scenarios.\n  The experiment involves a comprehensive MLOps workflow, covering essential\nphases like problem definition, data acquisition, data preparation, model\ndevelopment, model deployment, monitoring, management, scalability, and\ngovernance and compliance. Practical tips and recommendations are derived from\nthe results, emphasizing proactive planning and continuous improvement for the\nMLOps workflow.\n  The experimental investigation was strategically integrated within a\nreal-world ML project which followed essential phases of the MLOps process in a\nproduction environment, handling large-scale structured data. A systematic\ntracking approach was employed to document revisits to specific phases from a\nmain phase under focus, capturing the reasons for such revisits. By\nconstructing a matrix to quantify the degree of overlap between phases, the\nstudy unveils the dynamic and iterative nature of the MLOps workflow.\n  The resulting data provides visual representations of the MLOps process's\ninterdependencies and iterative characteristics within the experimental\nframework, offering valuable insights for optimizing the workflow and making\ninformed decisions in real-world scenarios. This analysis contributes to\nenhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of machine learning projects through\nan improved MLOps process.\n  Keywords: MLOps, Machine Learning Operations, Optimization, Experimental\nAnalysis, Iterative Process, Pattern Identification.",
